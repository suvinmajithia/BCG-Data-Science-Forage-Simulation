# BCG-Data-Science-Forage-Simulation

I completed a customer churn analysis and predictive modeling simulation for a major utility company (PowerCo), demonstrating expertise in diagnosis and practical model optimization.

Problem Solved: ðŸ“‰ Addressed a critical revenue threat where the initial model was functionally useless (only 5.5% recall), missing over 94% of at-risk customers due to class imbalance.

Skills Utilized: ðŸ’» Applied Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn) for robust data preparation, feature engineering, and training a Random Forest classifier. Utilized data visualization to communicate model flaws immediately.

Key Learning & Optimization: ðŸŽ¯ Learned that high accuracy is irrelevant for imbalanced business problems. Diagnosed the root cause as a conservative prediction threshold, not just hyperparameters. Strategically implemented a prediction threshold adjustment (from 0.50 to 0.15).

Business Impact: ðŸ“ˆ This optimization resulted in a 6Ã— increase in actionable intelligence, boosting the customer identification rate (Recall) to nearly 38%. This delivered a highly reliable list, ensuring maximum ROI on the client's intervention campaign.
